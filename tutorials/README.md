## Mask-RCNN Training and Inference
Code for training and running inference with the Matterport implementation of Mask R-CNN can be found in this [Jupyter Notebook](mask_rcnn/MaskRCNN_TrainAndInference.ipynb). The example uses a dataset that needs to be downloaded separately, but is linked in the notebook.
